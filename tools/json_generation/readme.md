This Powershell Script is written by me. To use is pull it in a folder with the raw extracted files with AssetStudio and create a new folder called "Generation". After that start the PS file and let it do its work. If a file is missing you need to edit the list in my Powershell file of what it should edit. That is a backup system so that i dont accidentally edit too many files like the "en-en.json" with it.

Known Issues
- Currently the Files created by this have spacing issues. This means you might have to edit the JSONs manually afterwards to correct the mistakes. I might try to fix those issues in a future version. Until then have fun.
