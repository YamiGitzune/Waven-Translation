This Powershell Script is written by me. To use is pull it in a folder with the raw extracted files with AssetStudio and create a new folder called "Generation". After that start the PS file and let it do its work. If a file is missing you need to edit the list in my Powershell file of what it should edit. That is a backup system so that i dont accidentally edit too many files like the "en-en.json" with it.
