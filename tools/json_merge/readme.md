This exe is used to merge all DLLs into an "en-en.json". It requires the Newtonsoft.DLL as that is a library to read JSON and reformat it. 

# How to merge to file
1. Make sure there isnt already a "en-en.json" file in your folder
2. Start the exe and check if its running through without an error. If there is an error, you need to find out which line causes the error and correct this
3. Move the "en-en.json" into your Waven Folder and try if the game can start with your "en-en.json"

## If you are using your own Github
1. Upload the file to your Github 
2. Make sure the DLL you are using is referencing to your Github

## If you are using my Github
1. You shouldnt be the one merging. Please just commit a change to the current translation folder or let me know on discord. (Waven Fan Discord https://discord.gg/WDMWVJRm8w)
